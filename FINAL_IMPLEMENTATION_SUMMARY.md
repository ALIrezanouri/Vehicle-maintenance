## What Still Needs to Be Done

Based on the original requirements checklist, here are the remaining items:

### Frontend
- [ ] Complete page implementations (Vehicles, Services, History, Pricing, Emergency pages)
- [ ] State management with React Context or Redux
- [ ] Responsive design optimizations for all components
- [ ] Animations and transitions
- [ ] Offline support implementation
- [ ] Complete test suite (unit and UI tests)

### Backend
- [ ] Complete test suite (unit and integration tests)
- [ ] Additional security measures implementation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Production deployment configuration

### Database
- [ ] Sample data for development
- [ ] Index optimization
- [ ] Backup strategy implementation

### Deployment
- [ ] Docker configuration for frontend and backend
- [ ] docker-compose setup
- [ ] Nginx configuration
- [ ] SSL configuration with Let's Encrypt
- [ ] Monitoring setup

### Documentation
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Admin user guide

## Next Steps for Completion

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Implement the remaining page components for each module
   - Add state management for global application state
   - Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Add animations and transitions for better UX

2. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Add additional security measures
   - Create complete API documentation
   - Set up production deployment configuration

3. **Deployment & Production**:
   - Create Docker configurations
   - Set up docker-compose for different environments
   - Configure Nginx and SSL
   - Set up monitoring and logging

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create user documentation
   - Generate API documentation
   - Write deployment guide
   - Create admin user guide

The foundation is now in place with all core functionality implemented. The next steps would be to build out the remaining UI components and add the supporting infrastructure for a production deployment.
